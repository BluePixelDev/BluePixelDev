# About Me
Hello, my name is Ondřej. I am a Unity game developer, C# programmer and web developer. Currently, I am working on my passion project, Retake. It is a Fast-Paced FPS, Rogulike game set in cyberspace in 2054.

# Retake?
Retake is my passion project developed in unity. It is an FPS/Roguelike game with cartoony and yet synthwavy visuals. The goal of the game is to *retake*, pun intended, back cyberspace from the hands of a dangerous and unrelenting virus, Netlock, overtaking over 99.98% of cyberspace in less than a week. Locking out all users from accessing the internet, Netlock began copying data from infected devices to an unknown location, believed to be their origin. You assume the role of a Reclaimer, tasked to find it, and on your journey, tearing through hordes of virus units sent out to stop you. Will you let them?
